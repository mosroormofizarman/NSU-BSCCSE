Certainly! Let's complete the table for methane (CH‚ÇÑ) based on the information provided:

Property 	Value 	
Formula of compound 	CH‚ÇÑ 	
Lewis Structure 	Four hydrogen atoms surrounding a central carbon atom, each connected by a single bond. 	
Bond Angles 	Approximately 109.5 degrees 	
# Of bonding e‚Åª groups (central atom) 	4 	
# Of non-bonding e‚Åª groups (central atom) 	0 (all electrons are shared with hydrogen atoms) 	
# Of total electron groups (central atom) 	4 	

Methane (CH‚ÇÑ) has a tetrahedral geometry, with the carbon atom at the center bonded to four hydrogen atoms. üß™üîç
