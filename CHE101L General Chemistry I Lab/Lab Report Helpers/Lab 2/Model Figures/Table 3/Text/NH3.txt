Certainly! Let's complete the table for ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ) based on the information provided:

Property 	Value 	
Formula of compound 	NH‚ÇÉ 	
Lewis Structure 	Nitrogen (N) connected to three hydrogen (H) atoms and one lone pair on the nitrogen atom. 	
Bond Angles 	Approximately 107 degrees 	
# Of bonding e‚Åª groups (central atom) 	3 	
# Of non-bonding e‚Åª groups (central atom) 	1 (lone pair on nitrogen) 	
# Of total electron groups (central atom) 	4 	

Ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ) has a trigonal pyramidal geometry, with the nitrogen atom at the center bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one lone pair. üß™üîç
