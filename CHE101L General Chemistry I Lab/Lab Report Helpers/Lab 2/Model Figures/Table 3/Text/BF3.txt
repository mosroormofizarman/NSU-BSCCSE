Certainly! Let's complete the table for boron trifluoride (BF‚ÇÉ) based on the information provided:

Property 	Value 	
Formula of compound 	BF‚ÇÉ 	
Lewis Structure 	Boron (B) is the central atom surrounded by three fluorine (F) atoms, each connected by a single bond. There are no lone pairs on the boron atom. 	
Bond Angles 	Approximately 120¬∞ 	
# Of bonding e‚Åª groups (central atom) 	3 	
# Of non-bonding e‚Åª groups (central atom) 	0 (no lone pairs on boron) 	
# Of total electron groups (central atom) 	3 	

Boron trifluoride (BF‚ÇÉ) has a trigonal planar geometry, with the boron atom at the center bonded to three fluorine atoms. üß™üîç
