1. 
If a calss doesn't consist of any
constructor method, compiler adds
a no-args constructor.
2.
But, if a class consists of any 
parameterized (with arguments) 
constructor, compiler doesn't add a
no-args constructor.
3.
When a constructor method is about
to be executed, compiler first checks
if there is any super/parent/base
class of the current class. If yes, 
compiler follows the rules below:
   3.1 
   If there is any call to the
   parameterized constructor of 
   current class,parameterized 
   constructor is called (invoked).
   3.2
   Otherwise, the no args constructor
   of the super/parent/base class is
   called (invoked).
