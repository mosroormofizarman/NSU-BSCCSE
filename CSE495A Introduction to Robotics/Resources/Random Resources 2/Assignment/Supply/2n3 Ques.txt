Ques 2)
Simulate the differential equations for the unicycle robot model using Euler’s method for t ∈ [0, 10]
and time step Δt = 0.1. Use the following control input:

v = 1 0 < t <10

w = 3 0.5 < t < 1.5
w = -3 2 < t < 3
w = -3 4 < t < 5
w = 3 6 < t < 7
w = -3 8 < t < 9
w = 0 all other t

With initial conditions x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, q(0) = 1.
Plot x vs y, x vs t, y vs t and q vs t. Submit your code and plots.
Feel free to simulate different ini3al condi3ons and control input sequences to gain a greater
understanding.
