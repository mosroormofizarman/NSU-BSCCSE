2) Simulate the dofferential equations for the unicycle robot model using Eucler's Model for t belongs to [0,10] and time step deltat = 0.1. use the following control input:
v = 1 where 0 <= t <= 10

w = 3, 0.5 <= t <= 1.5
w = -3, 2 <= t <= 3
w = -3, 4 <= t <= 5
w = 3, 6 <= t <= 7
w = -3, 8 <= t <= 9
w = 0, all other t

where w means omega

with initial conditions x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, thetha(0) = 1

Can you do the Euclers Method math for me?

Now do the code for me and explain the code.


3) Simulate the differential equations for the differential drive robot model using Eucler's Model for t belongs to [0,10] and time step deltat = 0.1. use the following control input:
v = 1 where 0 <= t <= 10

w = 12, 4 <= t <= 6
w = 12, 6 <= t <= 8
w = 1, all other t

w = 12, 0.5 <= t <= 1.5
w = 12, 2 <= t <= 4
w = 1, all other t

where w means omega

with initial conditions x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, thetha(0) = 1

Can you do the Euclers Method math for me?

Now do the code for me and explain the code.

4) The equations for a nonholonomic integrator are given by,
𝑥1dot = 𝑢1
𝑥2dot = 𝑢2
𝑥3dot = 𝑥2𝑢1
a) Show that this system is differentially flat for the flat output z = (x1, x3).
b) Assume the system moves from initial time ti = 0 to final time tf = T. Assume the following initial
conditions:
At ti = 0, x1(0), x2(0), x3(0), 𝑥3dot (0) = 1
At tf = T, x1(T), x2(T), x3(T), 𝑥3dot (𝑇) = 1
Using four basis func3ons, y1 = 1, y2 = t, y3 = t2, y4 = t3, write down the matrix-vector equations for this system. [Hint: Slide 22 in the differential flatness presentation might be helpful]
c) Plot the trajectory for this system for the following ini3al condi3ons. Submit your code and
screenshots.
i) At ti = 0, x1(0) = 1, x2(0) = 1, x3(0) = 0, 𝑥# ̇ (0) = 1
At tf = 10, x1(10) = 5, x2(10) = 5, x3(10) = 5, 𝑥# ̇ (10) = 1
ii) At ti = 0, x1(0) = 1, x2(0) = 1, x3(0) = 0, 𝑥# ̇ (0) = 1
At tf = 15, x1(15) = 10, x2(15) = 10, x3(15) = 5, 𝑥# ̇ (15) = 1
