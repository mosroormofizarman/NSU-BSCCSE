The equations for a nonholonomic integrator are given by,
(x1)'  (Derivative of x1) = u1
(x2)' (Derivative of x2)   = u2
(x3)' (Derivative of x3)  = x2u1
Assume the system moves from initial time ti = 0 to final time tf = T. Assume the following  initial conditions:
At ti = 0 when (x1)'(0)(Derivative of x1)=1 and x1(0), x2(0), x3(0) have unknown values.
At tf = T when (x1)'(T)(Derivative of x1)=1 and x1(T), x2(T), x3(T) have unknown values.
Using four basis functions, Ψ1 = 1, Ψ2 = t, Ψ3 = t^2, Ψ4 = t^3, write down the matrix-vector equations for this system.[Hint:  differential flatness]
