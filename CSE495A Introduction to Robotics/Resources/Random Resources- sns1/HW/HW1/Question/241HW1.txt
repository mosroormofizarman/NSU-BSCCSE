1) Write down the state space equations (differential equations) for the following robots. For each robot identify the state variables and the control variables.
a) Unicycle model
b) Differential drive robot
c) Simplified car model
ii) For a given robot, what do the state variables and control variables represent? Please explain.
iii) Describe the differences in dynamics between these robot models.

2)Simulate the differential equations for the unicycle robot model using Euler’s method for t∈[0, 10]
and time step ∆t = 0.1. Use the following control input:
v = 1  when  0 ≤ t ≤ 10
w = 3 when  0.5 ≤ t ≤ 1.5
w = -3 when  2 ≤ t ≤ 3
w = -3 when  4 ≤ t ≤ 5
w = 3 when  6 ≤ t ≤ 7
w = -3 when  8 ≤ t ≤ 9
w = 0 when  all other t
With initial conditions x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, θ(0) = 1.
a) Plot x vs y, x vs t, y vs t and  θ vs t. Submit your code and plots.
b) If you plot x vs y for each time step and create a movie of the robot moving in 2D space.
Feel free to simulate different initial conditions and control input sequences to gain a greater understanding.

3)Simulate the differential equations  for the differential drive robot model using 
Euler’s method for t∈[0, 10] and time step ∆t = 0.1. Use the following control input:
wl = 12 when  4 ≤ t ≤ 6
wl = 12 when  6 ≤ t ≤ 8
wl = 1 when  all other t
and
wr = 12 when  0.5 ≤ t ≤ 1.5
wr = 12 when  2 ≤ t ≤ 4
wr = 1 when  all other t
With  r = 0.1,  L = 1 and initial conditions x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, θ(0) = 1.
a) Plot x vs y, x vs t, y vs t and  θ vs t. Submit your code and plots.
b) If you plot x vs y for each time step and create a movie of the robot moving in 2D space.
